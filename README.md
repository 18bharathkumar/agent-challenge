## Topic

Nosana Builders Challenge, 2nd edition
Agent-101: Build your first agent

## Description

The main goal of this `Nosana Builders Challenge` to teach participants to build and deploy agents. This first step will be in running a basic AI agent and giving it some basic functionality. Participants will add a tool, for the tool calling capabilities of the agent. These are basically some python functions, that will, for example, retrieve some data from a weather API, post a tweet via an API call, etc.
