# Nosana Builders Challenge: Agent-101

## Topic

Nosana Builders Challenge, 2nd edition
Agent-101: Build your first agent

## Description

The main goal of this `Nosana Builders Challenge` to teach participants to build and deploy agents. This first step will be in running a basic AI agent and giving it some basic functionality. Participants will add a tool, for the tool calling capabilities of the agent. These are basically some python functions, that will, for example, retrieve some data from a weather API, post a tweet via an API call, etc.

## [ Mastra ] (<https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra>)

For this challenge we will be using Mastra to build our tool.

> Mastra is an opinionated TypeScript framework that helps you build AI applications and features quickly. It gives you the set of primitives you need: workflows, agents, RAG, integrations and evals. You can run Mastra on your local machine, or deploy to a serverless cloud.

## Get Started

To get started run the following command to start developing:
